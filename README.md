# AI-Avatar-Generation-Using-Stable-Diffusion
 
## Project Overview  
This project focuses on AI-driven avatar generation and face swapping using Stable Diffusion 2.1 and LoRA fine-tuning. It integrates MTCNN for face detection, InsightFace for facial analysis, and INSwapper for seamless face swapping while preserving identity details.  

## Features  
- AI-generated photorealistic avatars using Stable Diffusion 2.1.  
- LoRA fine-tuning for improved identity retention.  
- Face detection using MTCNN.  
- Facial recognition and feature extraction using InsightFace.  
- Realistic face swapping with INSwapper.  
- Color correction and blending for seamless face integration.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Stable Diffusion 2.1  
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)  
- MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)  
- InsightFace  
- OpenCV  

## Installation & Usage
